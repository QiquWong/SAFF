Forked by Erlend Hamnaberg 3rd sept. 2009.

This code comes from the AppFramework java.net project:
https://appframework.dev.java.net/ Go there for documentation, news,
updates, email aliases, and so on.  If you have questions or feedback
about the API, please subscribe to the AppFramework users mailing list
and send your feedback there:
https://appframework.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList (The
users email alias is the last one, all the way at the bottom.)

COPYING - announces that the code is LGPL
src/application - the framework itself
src/application/examples - a few small examples
dist/AppFramework.jar - the implementation (sans examples)
dist/javadoc/index.html - the javadoc (sans examples)
lib/swing-worker.jar - SwingWorker class for 1.5
test/application - JUnit tests; very spotty coverage


* Building the Source Code

for unix/windows:
mvn clean install

for OSX:
mvn clean install -P !WindowsUnix

Note that the tests are disabled for now in Maven. They will be enabled at a later stage, when I have figured
out why they don't run.
